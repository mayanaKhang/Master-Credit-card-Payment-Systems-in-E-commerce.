Letâ€™s mock up a Unix-based real-time transaction monitoring script that:  Structure of the Example generate_logs.sh â€“ Simulates incoming transactions (like streaming logs)  monitor_transactions.sh â€“ Monitors logs in real-time and detects issues  analyze_failure.py â€“ Parses and categorizes failure reasons


 #How to Test:
Start generate_logs.sh to simulate logs

In another terminal, run monitor_transactions.sh

Watch categorized real-time issue detection

ðŸ”§ #Possible Extensions
Push alerts via curl to Slack or PagerDuty

Store failures in a SQLite DB for dashboarding

Add retry logic or auto-healing scripts
